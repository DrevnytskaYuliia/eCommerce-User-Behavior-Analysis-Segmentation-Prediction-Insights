# eCommerce User Behavior Analysis

This project analyzes user behavioral data from a multi-category online store (Kaggle Open CDP dataset). It combines data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, classification, and regression to extract insights about customer behavior.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [![Kaggle Dataset](https://img.shields.io/badge/dataset-Kaggle-blue)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store)
- **Size**: 4 million+ events
- **Features**: user_id, event_type, product_id, category_id, timestamp, etc.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw event data
- Explore user and product behavior (EDA)
- Engineer features for modeling
- Cluster users based on behavioral patterns
- Classify purchase intent
- Predict purchase quantities using regression

## Tech Stack

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
